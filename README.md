# Celcat to ICS Next.JS WebApp

This is the Next.JS webapp for hosting the Celcat->ICS service [See Repository](https://github.com/aidenappl/celcat-gcal). The service is currently hosted on AWS in an ECS container and you can interact with the service through this basic Next.JS WebApp. All it takes is your northeastern.edu email address and returns the subscribable link if a valid check response is returned.   


# The Basics

This is the basic UI for intereacting with the service at [celcat.aplb.xyz](https://celcat.aplb.xyz/) and it is currently hosted in a free hobby account on Vercel. 

## Local Testing
You can fork or download this repository to run this webapp. It's built on NextJS and uses axios for making requests.
